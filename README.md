# CSCI401

Project Malmo Documentation - https://github.com/microsoft/malmo

This Github repository was referenced during the first few weeks of the project, as we had considered basing this existing repository and expand to the CSCI 401 Capstone Project.
While looking through the documentation and looking to replicate the project, a constant error came up from the README.md instructions; the following was able to resolve the issue and get Project Malmo to work: https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/blob/master/scripts/python-wheel/README.md#using-the-prebuilt-docker-image .
Docker Desktop was utilized during this stage of the project and the instructions were clear.

MineRL - https://github.com/minerllabs/minerl

While experimenting and researching possible tools for the project, MineRL was another package that was referenced and utilized. A more recent and maintained package, MineRL offered a bit more than Project Malmo so it was considered to be used more than the previous. The instructions on the README.md were clear.

NeuroMechCraft - https://github.com/jason-s-yu/neuromechcraft

Along with MineRL, NeuroMechCraft is a repository created by a group member that utilized MineRL versions 1.0 and 0.4.4. This repository was referenced and tested to ensure that the results obtained also functioned on other machines. This repository aimed to replicate the characteristics from NeuroMechFly (https://neuromechfly.org/installation.html), a resource that our stakeholder provided at the start of the project to get an idea of what the objective was.

Fly/Thorough Fly Response Policy

Both PDF files offer an insight to the fly behavior and response policy that would be implemented in a Minecraft setting. The documents look into a fly's behavior, considering its movement and instinct, as well as possible attractions and threats, to make an informed decision based on its surrounding. The document takes into consideration the biome, environment, and block encounters that a fly can be under. Edge cases for most scenarios are also considered, although there may be even more circumstances that a fly can be under in a Minecraft setting. State machine implementation is also present in the documentation, to demonstrate how the fly's behavior would change according to different stimuli. Some pseudocode is also provided to show how it could be realized in code.
